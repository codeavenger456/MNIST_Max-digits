## Abstract
This is the McGill MAIS202 Assignment 4/Kaggle competition. The goal in this assignment is to identify the largest numerical value in pictures that contain 3 handwritten numerical digits. The proposed and implemented algorithm to this task is a 5 layers convolution neural network. We implmeneted additional data generation using a image data geneartor from the Keras library, with careful trial and erros, a final testing accuracy of 98% was acheived.
